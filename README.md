### Problem Overview:

Big Data Analytics on Healthcare is currently in top demand in the software industries as the health data (EHR, PHR, EMR, etc.) increased exponentially over the past decade, with growing data repositories across healthcare systems.  The leverage of the rising Big Data to discover the knowledge and insights of data required prior skills and expertise in data pre-processing, statistics, data mining, machine learning, and programming languages as well. Applications of big data analytics on health can improve the patient-based service, detect spreading diseases earlier, generate new insights into disease mechanisms, monitor the quality of the medical and healthcare institutions as well as provide better treatment methods.

### Learning Outcome:

During the virtual training program, you will learn/develop the following expertise/skills by solving real-life problems using anonymous data:

- Structure of clinical laboratory, environmental, and census data 
- Data pre-processing, noise reduction, missing value imputation, normalization, and standardization.
- Multidimensional data modeling (e.g. star schema, snowflake schema)
- Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
- Aggregation, correlation, association, clustering, prediction, and Data visualization
